	The red quasar HAQ2225+0527 (z = 2.33) observed with the ALFOSC
	instrument at the NOT in August 2014. The top panel shows with a black, solid line
	the grism 4 spectrum (R=400 covering the full optical range from 3700 &Aring; to
	9000 &Aring;, 1200 sec exposure time) together with the SDSS and UKIDSS photometry
	(shown with red points). There is a damped Ly&alpha; absorber (DLA) at z = 2.13 in the blue end of the
	spectrum. The dashed, blue curve shows a normal quasar spectrum (a composite)
	and the red curve shows a reddened quasar composite spectrum assuming an
	SMC-like extinction with A<sub>V</sub> = 0.42 at the redshift of the foreground DLA.
	When we saw that this was a good candidate for a quasar reddened by a
	foreground DLA we secured further spectroscopy with grism 6 (R = 980, covering
	the UV region and up to about 5500 &Aring;, 9000 sec exposure time) to measure
	the Hydrogen column density (the red line in the lower left panel shows a DLA fit
	with a column density of 5.2 x 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>) and with grism 17
	(R=5750, covering about 500 &Aring; around H&alpha;, 9000 sec exposure time) to
	measure the column density of Zn <small>II</small> [marked with a solid, vertical line in the
	lower right panel]. The metallicity measured from Zn <small>II</small> appears to be slightly
	larger than solar metallicity (but the error bar is substantial due to the low S/N of the NOT data,
	about 0.3 dex). The position of transitions from the strongly refractory element Cr are
	marked with dotted vertical lines. From the absence of Cr <small>II</small> lines we infer very strong
	depletion, ([Zn/Cr] &gtrsim; 1.7). Furthermore, the system contains cold gas
	(strong C <small>I</small> absorption is detected in the grism 6 spectrum) which,
	based on our previous observations of C <small>I</small> absorbers, implies that it almost certainly
	will show molecular Hydrogen and possibly CO molecular absorption.

	This quasar was subsequently observed with the intermediate resolution spectrograph X-Shooter at the
	Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. The spectrum covers the wavelength range from 3200 to 25000 &Aring;
	and allowed us to carry out a more detailed analysis of the dust reddening (see figure below). We were further
	able to model the physical conditions in the cloud using absorption lines from C <small>I</small> and its
	fine-structure transitions. This fine-structure analysis shows that the absorbing cloud giving rise to C <small>I</small>
	lines is very compact (less than 1 pc) and covers only part of the background quasar emission region.

			The observed X-shooter spectrum in black has been smoothed and the strong telluric absorption bands
			in the near-infrared have been masked out for visual clarity. The yellow squares marks the photometry
			from SDSS (u, g, r, i, z), UKIDSS (Y, J, H, K), and WISE (W<sub>1</sub>). The blue solid line shows the unreddened
			intrinsic quasar template. The red line shows the best-fit dust-reddened model including variations from iron emission lines.
			The dark blue dashed line shows the best-fit model without iron line variations included.

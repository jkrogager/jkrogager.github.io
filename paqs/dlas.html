            Studying HI absorption in spectra of luminous background sources such as quasars is the best way to probe neutral
            hydrogen in individual galaxies beyond the local Universe (z ≳ 0.1) until the advent of the Square Kilometer Array. Of
            particular interest for galaxy evolution studies are the so-called Damped Lyman-α Absorbers (DLAs; Wolfe et al. 2005),
            whose large column densities of HI (log[N<sub>HI</sub>&nbsp;/&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>] > 20.3) arise in self-shielded, galactic environments. The neutral
            gas at even higher column densities (log[N<sub>HI</sub>&nbsp;/&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>] ≥ 21.5) is sensitive to many physical processes, such as the
            formation of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and subsequently star formation (Bird et al. 2014; Noterdaeme et al. 2014).
            
            Another important aspect of galaxy evolution is the build-up of metals over time and the redistribution of metals in and
            around galaxies. Observations of DLAs offer a precise and model-independent way of measuring metallicities at high
            redshift through the numerous metal absorption lines observed in optical spectra of distant quasars (Prochaska et al.
            2003; De Cia et al. 2018).
            
            Owing to the cross-section selection of absorbers and the insensitivity of the Lyman-alpha transition on temperature,
            DLAs probe mostly the warm neutral medium (T ~ 10<sup>4</sup>K). The cold neutral medium (T ~ 100K) is best traced by H<sub>2</sub>, found only in
            a few percent of the overall DLA population (Balashev & Noterdaeme 2018). At high redshift, H<sub>2</sub> is directly detectable in
            optical spectra through Lyman and Werner bands in the rest-frame UV (900–1100Å). The simulated quasar spectrum shown in
            Fig. 1 (left panel) illustrates the molecular and atomic absorption features expected in our survey.

        <h3>The unbiased cosmic mass density of metals from 2 &lt; z &lt; 3</h3>
        <article>
            It has been shown that DLAs trace a significant fraction of metals over cosmic time, reaching ~100% of the inferred
            metal mass, Ω<sub>Met,&nbsp;TOT</sub>, at z = 4 (Péroux & Howk 2020). However, this fraction is observed to decrease with decreasing
            redshift based on optically selected samples. The colour-selection criteria of current optical quasar samples introduce
            a redshift dependence on the dust bias (Krogager et al. 2019) that directly affects the measured cosmic mass density of
            metals, Ω<sub>Met</sub>. While Ω<sub>Met</sub> at z = 3 may be underestimated by a factor of ~2, this increases to a factor of ~3 at z = 2.
            Such a redshift-dependent bias would counteract the observed decrease in Ω<sub>Met</sub> / Ω<sub>Met,&nbsp;TOT</sub>. Our aim with this survey is
            to constrain Ω<sub>Met</sub> as a function of redshift from an unbiased sample of nearly 2000 high-redshift DLAs.

        <h3>The unbiased absorption cross-section of HI and H<sub>2</sub> at z &gt; 2</h3>
        <article>
            Current numerical simulations are still unable to reproduce the observed redshift evolution of the HI absorption
            cross-section as inferred by the so-called line incidence, dn/dz (Bird et al. 2014; Hassan et al. 2020). If a dust bias
            is present in current observations, it is important to correct for this before drawing conclusions about feedback
            mechanisms in simulations. Moreover, simulations are only recently starting to resolve the cold (H<sub>2</sub>) and warm (HI)
            neutral media in cosmological volumes (e.g., Nickerson et al. 2019; Feldmann et al. 2022). Hence, constraining the dn/dz
            of H<sub>2</sub> and HI in an unbiased sample will provide the first comparison to these new simulations.
